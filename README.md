SQL database for tracking car transactions and service maintenances 

In this project, we were asked to design and develop information systems for SLO Vintage Auto. 
To lead the project and deal with any uncertainties as they arise. 

The outcome of this engagement includes the following:
1. Systems specification / documentation including:
a. Enterprise ER diagram
b. Statement of understanding of the requirements (i.e., anything that is not clearly specified in the ER diagram including any assumptions you make).
c. Create a naming scheme for your entities, attributes, etc. (state what this scheme is)
d. State all integrity constraints including referential, mandatory (not null), check, and primary key. Note that these must then be implemented in your design.
e. Submit listings of all your SQL code.
2. A working prototype of the system with Oracle as the backend and an APEX app as the front end.
3. Populate the database with sufficient data to show that it works and that all the queries work correctly
Tasks which your system must be able to perform include:
1. Storing information about customers, preferences, employees, sale invoices, auto vendors, purchase orders, vehicles, service invoices, services offered, and parts.
2. Be able to add a record, edit, and delete a record for each of these entities and any associative entities that you believe exist.
3. Maintain quality control via data integrity (e.g., the sales price of a vehicle cannot be a negative value).
